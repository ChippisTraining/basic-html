    <p>
        it is complicated to say wich doctor is the best i mean
    </p>

    <p>
        <br>...the 9th doctor was the first doctor of the new series and was a great doctor. he was always so serious
        but he was also funny.
        <br>...the 10th doctor was the best doctor. he was funny, serious, and had a great companion.
        <br>...the 11th doctor was adhd energy funny but later we saw his hurt and pain. he was a great doctor.
        <br>...the 12th doctor was a great doctor. he was funny, serious, and had a great companion. but the start was
        more slow and angry cause he began as a old and crumpy then became dr house in some sense
        <br>...the 13th doctor was pure chaos i loved it
